**System environment configuration:**  
  1、Linux  
  2、Python 3.6.10  
  3、pytorch 1.7.1  
  For more detailed configuration, see the file environment.yml  

**Running steps：**  
  1、Download the entire project to the local machine  
  2、Ensure the environment is correctly configured  
  3、Start the project: Use the appropriate command to start the project based on the type of project:  
    python filename.py  

**Tips:**  
  1、classifer_attention_fading_gpu1.py contains the complete model  
  2、The download paths for the datasets used in the paper are all included in the dataset.txt file
